<p> <img src="K L RAHUL.jpg" width="200px" height="200px">Kannaur Lokesh Rahul, is a promising young batsman from Karnataka, who made his first-class with his state side and had a decent debut season in 2010-11. Though he was left out of the squad for the next season, Rahul returned for the 2012-13 edition of the Ranji Trophy.

The 2013-14 season was a great season for Rahul and Karnataka as he topped the batting charts for his side and became one of the very batsmen to score more than 1000 runs in a season.

This feat earned him an IPL contract with Sunrisers Hyderabad in 2014 and he played a considerable number of matches. He was also part of the Royal Challengers Bangalore setup in 2013.

Bookmarked as one of India's generation next players, it didn't take too long for Rahul to step into the Indian team. He was selected for the Australian tour in 2014-15 on the back of some big runs at domestic level. Rahul sat out of the first two Tests and it was clear that he was a mental wreck when he made his Test debut at the historical Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG).
