Hardik Pandya portrays the 'IPL breed'. A category of players catapulted into the limelight with constant exposure to prime-time television. Confidence, fearlessness, hardly any flicker of intimidation while rubbing shoulders with the best. It's not as if the Baroda swashbuckler wasn't creating ripples in the domestic circuit. His big-hitting abilities were well documented by those who played with or against him. But then came IPL 2015. 

Roped in by Mumbai Indians, Pandya was a revelation. Clean ball-striking, playing live-wire in the field, rolling his arm over, he did it all. Ended up playing a pivotal role in the franchise's second title triumph fetching two Man of the Match awards. So indelible was the then 21-year old's footprint, it prompted someone like Ricky Ponting (MI's head coach for the season) to shower rich praise on his attitude. 

Despite being predominantly noted for his batting, Pandya is no slouch with the ball. In fact, it was his all-round skills which caught the attention of MI's top-level management during the Syed Mushtaq Ali tournament culminating in his eventual contract. Look what a year's difference can make. He is all set to embark on the road to stardom with a maiden India call-up for the T20s Down Under.
