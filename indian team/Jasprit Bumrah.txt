He grabbed eyeballs with his slingy action that has troubled many batsmen. Because of his variety in delivering the ball, Jasprit Bumrah was handed an IPL contract by Mumbai Indians (MI) in 2013 even before he made his first-class debut. 

Bumrah plays first-class cricket for Gujarat and he made his debut against Vidarbha during the 2013-14 season. He had a great game indeed, picking up 7 wickets in the match. Eventually, he ended the tournament as the side's leading wicket-taker. 

Though he played just a couple of games in IPL-6, his impressive show in the domestic circuit convinced the MI management to buy him back for IPL-7.
